## ðŸŽ“ Education

**Bachelor Degree: Physics** - UniversitÃ  di Modena e Reggio Emilia
September 2008 - July 2011
- Thesis in computation/statistical Physics applied to Biophysics: performed
GROMACS simulations in an HPC environment (IBM BlueGene/P) and analysed the
result trajectories with Python/NumPy.
- Final grade: 110/110 _Summa cum laude_

**Bachelor Degree: Theology** - Studio Teologico Interdiocesano di Reggio Emilia
2011-2017

In these years I had the desire to explore a different point of view on life and on na-
ture, so I completed a whole cycle of philosophical/theological studies, during which
my scientific background came back to me as a solid method and as a term of com-
parison. Though at first I was interested in becoming a priest, at the end came the
decision not to go through that path and to go for more exploration.

**Taxdoo connector for Magento**

One day I was taking a walk with a friend, telling him that I'd like to switch to Software Development, that I think I would have the skills,
but how to prove it without neither experience, nor a proper University title?

He was working at Taxdoo, and he told me that they were still lacking a connector for Magento:
that's how we came up with the idea that I try to implement one, and see if it catches the attention of recruiters.

In the next couple of months I came up with a functioning plugin (see the [GitHub Link](https://github.com/andrea-aus-hh/taxdoo-magento2-extension/)), which indeed caught their attention.
