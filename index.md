## ðŸŽ“ Education

### Bachelor degree: Physics
#### September 2008 - July 2011

UniversitÃ  di Modena e Reggio Emilia
- Thesis in computation/statistical Physics applied to Biophysics: performed
GROMACS simulations in an HPC environment (IBM BlueGene/P) and analysed the
result trajectories with Python/NumPy.
- Final grade: 110/110 _Summa cum laude_

### Bachelor degree: Theology
#### September 2011-2017
- Studio Teologico Interdiocesano di Reggio Emilia
2011-2017

In these years I had the desire to explore a different point of view on life and on na-
ture, so I completed a whole cycle of philosophical/theological studies, during which
my scientific background came back to me as a solid method and as a term of com-
parison. Though at first I was interested in becoming a priest, at the end came the
decision not to go through that path and to go for more exploration.

**Taxdoo connector for Magento**

One day, while I was taking a walk with a friend, I told him that I'd like to switch to Software Development, that I think I would have the skills,
but how to prove it without neither experience, nor a proper University title?

He was working at Taxdoo, and he told me that they were still lacking a connector for Magento:
see where it goes? In the next 1.5 months I came up with a functioning plugin
(see the [GitHub Link](https://github.com/andrea-aus-hh/taxdoo-magento2-extension/)), which caught the attention of their recruiters.
