## 💻 Projects

### Taxdoo connector for Magento

One day, while I was taking a walk with a friend, I told him that I'd like to switch to Software Development, that I think I would have the skills,
but how to prove it without neither experience, nor a proper University title?

He was working at Taxdoo, and he told me that they were still lacking a connector for Magento:
see where it goes? In the next 1.5 months I came up with a functioning plugin
(see the [GitHub Link](https://github.com/andrea-aus-hh/taxdoo-magento2-extension/)), which caught the attention of their recruiters.
