# My resume

This repository contains the source code for my professional resume, available in two formats:
- The LaTeX version, for when a polished PDF two-pager is needed
  - The PDF is built after each commit on master, and published here as a release.
- A Markdown version, hosted on GitHub Pages (see [here](https://resume.andrea-aus-hh.de/)).

## Contributing

Raising a Pull Request would be a clever way to invite me for an interview.
