### Operating Systems

- I started with Windows, as a kid that simply wanted to play Age of Empires II
- I became a Linux user in 2004 (Fedora 1), still played Age of Empires II via [wine](https://www.winehq.org/). Fedora was then replaced by Mandrake, then by Gentoo.
- Switched to Mac OS X in 2011: a [Hackintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackintosh) first, then a proper Mac.
- Now again a regular Linux user (Fedora 40) on my private computer.
