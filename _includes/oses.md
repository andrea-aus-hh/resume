### Operating Systems

As a kid I used what we had at home, Windows PCs (from 3.1 to 10), on which I was content to fumble around and play Age of Empires II.

I became a Linux user in 2004 (Fedora 1). Not content with Fedora, I hopped through many distributions, then settled on Gentoo.
I could also still play Age of Empires II via [wine](https://www.winehq.org/).

On a wave of fascination for their design philosophy, I switched to Mac OS X in 2011:
a [Hackintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackintosh) first, then the real thing.

Since 2023 I'm again a regular Linux user (Fedora 40) on my private computer.
