### Operating Systems

As a kid I simply used what we had at home, Windows PCs. Also I was happy to play Age of Empires II.

I became a Linux user in 2004 (Fedora 1), still played Age of Empires II via [wine](https://www.winehq.org/).
Not content with Fedora, I hopped through many distributions, then settled on Gentoo.

Switched to Mac OS X in 2011: a [Hackintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackintosh) first, then a real Mac.

Since 2023 again a regular Linux user (Fedora 40) on my private computer.
