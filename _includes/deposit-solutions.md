<p class='date'>December 2019 - September 2021</p>

**Tasks**:
1. Maintenance of our Performance Marketing accounts for the finance portal ZINSPILOT
2. Taking care of tracking and Google Analytics
3. Analysis of performance data.

**Two relevant side projects**:

- **Customer Notifications for ZINSPILOT**: in order to use our IT resources more
efficiently, I suggested to implement personalised notifications for our customers
through Google Tag Manager, in a way that requires minimal IT effort and gives
the marketing team full flexibility. Iâ€™ve been responsible of the ideation, design,
implementation, testing and tracking.
- **Customer Lifetime Value Analysis for ZINSPILOT**. I executed the data prepara-
tion, analysis and visualization with Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, Tensor-
Flow).
