### (Senior) Software Engineer :: [Taxdoo GmbH](https://www.taxdoo.com)
<p class='date'>October 2021 - present</p>

**What am I the proudest of?**

- Refactoring of a large in-memory processing into a Java Streams based one, which uses an arbitrarily low memory footprint.
- Containerisation of services for easier testability in CI/CD pipelines.
- How I entered this job in the first place: see [Taxdoo connector for Magento](#magento)
- Having started as a Junior, and having now the title of Senior.

**Technologies I touch every day**

- Java 21 code, running on ECS and AWS Lambda
- The data is mostly stored on MySQL/DynamoDB Databases, S3 Buckets
- Infrastructure on AWS, provisioned via CDK: Lambda, S3, RDS, Step Functions, SQS, SNS, Eventbridge
- Gitlab CI/CD pipelines

**Technologies I touch relatively often**

- Backend/frontend TypeScript
- Golang

**Ok, but why is senior in parenthesis?**

My title is indeed Senior Software Engineer. This being my first proper Software Engineer job, I struggle at calling myself Senior.

However, I still feel proud of having started as a junion in a place, and now being considered a Senior.
