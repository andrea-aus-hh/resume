**The highlights**

- Refactoring of in-memory processing into a Java Streams based one, with an arbitrarily low memory footprint.
- Replacement of weakly typed variables with strong domain-rooted types
- Containerisation of services for easier testability in CI/CD pipelines.
- Having started as a Junior, and having now the title of Senior.
