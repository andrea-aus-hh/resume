### Taxdoo connector for Magento<a name="magento"></a>

Wanting to move from Online Marketing into Software Development, I knew I’d need a way to show recruiters and interviewers what I could do.

When a friend at Taxdoo mentioned they still needed a Magento connector and that they could set me up with a Taxdoo account, I saw the perfect opportunity: not only I had a concrete project to work on, but it could even attract the attention of recruiters. I forked a similar plugin from TaxJar as a starting point, then customized it to work with Taxdoo’s API. After about a month and a half, I had a fully working plugin up and running on GitHub. The project got indeed the attention of recruiters, giving me a strong entry point into development.
