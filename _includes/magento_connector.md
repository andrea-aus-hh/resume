### Taxdoo connector for Magento<a name="magento"></a>

One day during the pandemic I was telling a friend that I was bored of Online Marketing, and that I would see myself in Software Development:
I would have the skills, but how shall I prove it without experience, or a CS University title?

He mentioned that Taxdoo, his employer back then, was still lacking a connector for Magento,
that they had a public API for people to build integrations. What if you be the one building it?

Why not, I thought, I wanted anyway to start building a portfolio of projects, why not this one? In the next 1.5 months I built a functioning plugin
(see the [GitHub Link](https://github.com/andrea-aus-hh/taxdoo-magento2-extension/)), which caught the attention of the recruiters.
